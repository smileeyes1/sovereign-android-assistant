# Hakim component baselines and promotion gates

## Cloud / ChatGPT bridge — LAST_VERIFIED_BASELINE
- Verified production commit: `c84359e422dad0aa205f59a153a1f29d7f4c4e81`.
- Railway production deployment of that commit is SUCCESS.
- External acceptance passed: `/health` = `ok:true`; exact ChatGPT connector callback accepted.
- Negative regression passed: wrong host, userinfo injection, lookalike path, query mutation, and unknown scope remain rejected.

This cloud baseline is the rollback target for bridge/OAuth work until a successor passes the same relevant production checks.

## Android field lineage
- Historical last promoted field baseline: versionCode `20087`, package `ps.hakim.stable`, D1 signer lineage.
- Version `20090` was installed later but was NOT PROMOTED after UX acceptance failed.
- Exact source-to-APK correspondence for the field 20087/20090 build is NOT PROVEN from the currently connected public repository.
- Modern public Android source used for this candidate starts from commit `d3ae6946b2d63e402a1b597dbc93ab5d58efa12f` on `feature/hakim-capability-kernel-v1` (source versionCode 20088).
- Field evidence on 20091: Google Play Protect hard-blocked sideload installation while Accessibility/Notification Listener surfaces were declared.
- Field evidence on 20092: the prior Play Protect hard block was removed, but Hakim exposed an impossible unknown-app-source/install permission prompt.
- Field evidence on 20093: that stale install-source prompt was removed; a new defect remained—typing «مرحبا» and pressing «أنجز» opened ChatGPT and exposed the long governed prompt instead of answering inside Hakim.

## Current Android candidate
- Candidate versionCode: `20097`.
- Branch: `feature/hakim-20097-keyboard-aware-local-help`.
- Field evidence on 20096 proved the conversation transcript is visible and persistent.
- New field evidence: asking «لماذا لوحة المفاتيح تغطي مكان الكتابة» was unnecessarily routed to ChatGPT even though it is a question about Hakim's own UI. The Android keyboard also reduced the usable floating-window area.
- 20097 keeps Hakim self-UI help local, adds a keyboard-specific local reply, and enforces `adjustResize` in both manifest and runtime so the composer stays visible when the IME opens.
- Status starts as SOURCE/CI CANDIDATE ONLY and does not replace the field baseline until the exact signed APK passes the same field prompt without opening ChatGPT and the composer remains visible with the keyboard open.

## Promotion rule
A newer component inherits no success automatically. Promote only after the tests relevant to what changed pass on the same artifact/deployment that is delivered. If a field-signing credential is unavailable, keep the Android candidate explicitly NOT INSTALLABLE / NOT PROMOTED.
